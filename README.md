# Abstract
Cellular automata, in its primitive form, was first introduced to literature throughthe  work  of  Von-Neumann  in  the  1950s.   Interest  has  grown  since  then,  with  theprimary catalysts in this being Conway’s Game of Life in 1970 and Wolfram’s NewKind of Science in 2002.  In recent years, as neural-network-based machine learninghas grown in theory, scope, and application, the combination of cellular automataand neural networks has evolved from a merely theoretical exercise to one primar-ily concerned with application.  In this paper,  we aim to build upon the previousworks of neural cellular automata by introducing new and existing model architec-tures,  complete  with  experimentation  and  discussion,  in  the  context  of  an  imagesegmentation task.
